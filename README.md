# Computational-Physics
This repository contains all the projects developed during the second semester of 2024 for the Computational Physics class. Most of the order of the course was chose by following the book _Computational Physics_ by Nicholas J. Giordano and Hisao Nakanishi. 

Each project was developed using the environment Pluto, with the Julia programming language. The results were Pluto notebooks that enhance interactivy, include code, visualizations (most of them are animations) and detailed explanations about the physical phenomena and the numerical methods used to achieve the simulations. These components bring together an integral and relevant work for each topic covered.
